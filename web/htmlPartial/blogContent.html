            <strong>Homework 3 – Home Page:</strong> 
            <p>
                My Web Development experience was pretty interesting. I decided to try some different
                styles to come up with a web page that I thought most fit what it is that I am creating.
                The main things I focused on was coherency and legibility.

            </p>
            <p>
                The techniques I used to create this was to group different areas and provide classes and tags
                for those sections that I wanted to coordinate. I add a background image that I fixed into place so
                that as the user scrolls down the image maintains its position. I also added this feature to the 
                Title and navigation bar so that as the person is moving through the site they are able to access the bar
                at any position in the site without have to scroll up. In order to add to the overall look and feel of
                the site I add a drop-box shadow to the title navigation bar that has about a 5px blur making it look
                as though the title navigation bar is floating over the web page as you scroll through it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I learned more about css and how to organize my html in such a way to make it more readable and 
                easier to navigate. I also learned how to make objects have a fixed position along with creating 
                shadow affects for my different objects. I also set up a github for this project and learned how to maintain 
                the project via the git tools in netbeans.

            <strong>Data Model:</strong>
            <p>
                My data model includes 4 tables, web_user, user_role, campaign_sessions, and campaign_session_posting.
                Campaign_session_posting is the associative table that connects web_users with a campaign_session that they
                would like to sign up for.

            <strong>Homework 4 – Display Data:</strong> 
            <p>
                What was hard.... building a drop down menu item on the nav bar was hard.
                Everything else was pretty simple to work with. There were definitely errors
                made but they were pretty easy to solve and figure out how to work around.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is the error doc that is supposed to be here: <a class="WhiteLink" href="docs/HW4Errors.docx">Error Doc</a>

            <strong>Homework 5 – Log On:</strong> 
            <p>
                What was hard.... figuring out how the sessions objects worked.
                Also...... css is just a pain. I spent way to much time fiddling with it.

            <strong>Homework 6 – Insert:</strong> 
            <p>
                What was hard.... Handling error messages in a friendly manner.

            <strong>Homework 7 – Delete:</strong> 
            <p>
                What was hard.... Handling error messages in a friendly manner.
                I don't feel that this was much different then the insert hw.

            <strong>Tutorial:</strong> 
            <p>
                What was hard.... Figuring out how I was going to manage all the 
                information in the databases and display it.

            <strong>Homework 8 – Update:</strong> 
            <p>
                What was hard.... I would say that figuring out how I was going 
                set the values for the auto populated drop down lists was hard.
                I had to go through several ideas until I was able to solve it
                by using the .includes function and looping through the list of
                available options innerHTML to match them.
                
                Other then that it was pretty simple since most of it was just 
                a rehash of the insert code.
