                My Web Development experience was pretty interesting. I decided to try some different
                styles to come up with a web page that I thought most fit what it is that I am creating.
                The main things I focused on was coherency and legibility.

                The techniques I used to create this was to group different areas and provide classes and tags
                for those sections that I wanted to coordinate. I add a background image that I fixed into place so
                that as the user scrolls down the image maintains its position. I also added this feature to the 
                Title and navigation bar so that as the person is moving through the site they are able to access the bar
                at any position in the site without have to scroll up. In order to add to the overall look and feel of
                the site I add a drop-box shadow to the title navigation bar that has about a 5px blur making it look
                as though the title navigation bar is floating over the web page as you scroll through it.

                I learned more about css and how to organize my html in such a way to make it more readable and 
                easier to navigate. I also learned how to make objects have a fixed position along with creating 
                shadow affects for my different objects. I also set up a github for this project and learned how to maintain 
                the project via the git tools in netbeans.
