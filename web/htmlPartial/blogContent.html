                My experience with css this week involved mostly the design elements. Such as selecting a color pallete
                that I thought would go well with the subject matter that I have chosen.

            <!--<strong>Text</strong>: Make sure that all of your text is 
            <strong><em style="margin-right:0.5ex;">ALWAYS</em></strong> 
            easy to read - make your text large enough and with enough contrast w.r.t. 
            its background. Background images are nice, but never allow them to 
            interfere with readability. Use size, opacity (partial transparency), color selection, 
            and/or "box shadow"
            to help with legibility of text on background images.
            Use padding and/or margin to prevent 
            text from being too close to any visible edge. Remember to style link text 
            (&lt;a&gt; tags) as well as "regular text".-->
            <strong>Character Information:</strong> Store basic character information for all your characters
            and select which one you will be using for the session.

            <!--<strong>Fluid Design/Measurements</strong>: Your web site must have a fluid (not fixed) design. 
            With fluid design, your text will wrap (according to how wide the browser window is) - 
            instead of having a horizontal scroll bar that forces the user to work hard 
            to read the text on the page. You get a fluid design by specifying widths in % not pixels.
            At very narrow widths, wrapping will be undesirable (e.g., your nav links may wrap 
            down on top of content). To prevent this, apply the CSS 
            "min-width" property (in pixels) to your titleNav. Then whenever the user tries 
            to size the browser narrower that the min-width that you specified, 
            they will get the horizontal scroll bar, preventing the nav links
            from undesirable wrapping. 

            It is fine (and recommended) to use pixels to measure things vertically 
            (like font sizes, padding, and margins), but try to use percentages for widths. 
            <strong>Before you finalize your layout</strong>, narrow 
            your browser width slowly and make sure it looks good at all widths. -->
            <strong>Campaign Tracking:</strong> Know which campaign each character is involved with and when
            the next session will be held for that campaign.
