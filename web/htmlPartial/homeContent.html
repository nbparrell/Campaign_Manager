        Tired of always having to text your friends or email them about when and where your session of dungeons and dragons is going to be held tonight?
        Tired of trying to keep track of who's house your going to? 
        Now you don't have to, with our Campaign Manager you will be able to post in advance where and when you are going to be holding a session for a specific campaign. 
        Your players can then sign up and have all the information nicely shown for you with which character they are going to be playing. 
        Never worry about the head count again. Hope you enjoy out Campaign Manager.
