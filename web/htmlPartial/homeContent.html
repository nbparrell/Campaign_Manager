                <p>
                    Tired of always having to text your friends or email them about when and where your session of dungeons and dragons is going to be held tonight?
                    Tired of trying to keep track of who's house your going to? 
                    Now you don't have to, with our Campaign Manager you will be able to post in advance where and when you are going to be holding a session for a specific campaign. 
                    Your players can then sign up and have all the information nicely shown for you with which character they are going to be playing. 
                    Never worry about the head count again. Hope you enjoy out Campaign Manager.
                </p>

                        <strong><em style="margin-right:0.5ex;">ALWAYS</em></strong> 
                        easy to read - make your text large enough and with enough contrast w.r.t. 
                        its background. Background images are nice, but never allow them to 
                        interfere with readability. Use size, opacity (partial transparency), color selection, 
                        and/or "box shadow"
                        to help with legibility of text on background images.
                        Use padding and/or margin to prevent 
                        text from being too close to any visible edge. Remember to style link text 
                        (&lt;a&gt; tags) as well as "regular text".-->
                        <strong>Character Information:</strong> Store basic character information for all your characters
                        and select which one you will be using for the session.

                        <!--<strong>Fluid Design/Measurements</strong>: Your web site must have a fluid (not fixed) design. 
                        With fluid design, your text will wrap (according to how wide the browser window is) - 
                        instead of having a horizontal scroll bar that forces the user to work hard 
                        to read the text on the page. You get a fluid design by specifying widths in % not pixels.
                        At very narrow widths, wrapping will be undesirable (e.g., your nav links may wrap 
                        down on top of content). To prevent this, apply the CSS 
                        "min-width" property (in pixels) to your titleNav. Then whenever the user tries 
                        to size the browser narrower that the min-width that you specified, 
                        they will get the horizontal scroll bar, preventing the nav links
                        from undesirable wrapping. 

                        It is fine (and recommended) to use pixels to measure things vertically 
                        (like font sizes, padding, and margins), but try to use percentages for widths. 
                        <strong>Before you finalize your layout</strong>, narrow 
                        your browser width slowly and make sure it looks good at all widths. -->
                        <strong>Campaign Tracking:</strong> Know which campaign each character is involved with and when
                        the next session will be held for that campaign.
